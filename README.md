# machine-learning-code
These are the codes for machine learning techniques that I implemented after took class ISYE 6740 Computational Data Analysis at Georgia Tech
I've learned a lot from this course, where I build ML techniques/models from the scratch. 
I'd like to share it with all the others who want to learn machine learning

Language: Matlab

Contents:
1. Kmeans, Kmedoids method
2. Density estimation: histogram + KDE(kernel density estimation)
3. PCA ( Principal Component Analysis )
4. Bayes classification, KNN classification, Logistic regression
5. SVM, subgradient descent and stochastic subgradient descent
